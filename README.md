Q1 Use the same dataset given in the previous assignment: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanbadai/clothes-dataset . Design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify clothing images into their respective categories using pytorch. Compare your results with the previous assignment model performance. Show how the model performance is impacted after decreasing the number of convolution layers in your implementation.

Q2 Use the amazon review dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews/data for sentiment classification. Train BiLSTM model with 80% train, 10% validation and 10% test split to predict the sentiment as positive or negative. Use different drop out values (0.2, 0.4, 0.6) at lstm and embedding layers to compare the model performance in terms of training loss, validation macro F1 and test macro F1. 
Evaluate your model performance by introducing noise such as spelling mistake and synonym replacement in your test data.
